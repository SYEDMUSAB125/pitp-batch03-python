Problem 1: Tuple Unpacking
Create a tuple my_tuple containing three elements: (10, 20, 30). Unpack the tuple into three variables a, b, and c. Print the values of a, b, and c.

Problem 2: List Manipulation
Create a list my_list with the following elements: [5, 10, 15, 20, 25]. Perform the following operations:

Append the number 30 to the list.

Remove the second element from the list.

Insert the number 12 at the beginning of the list.

Print the final list.

Problem 3: Tuple Concatenation
Create two tuples: tuple1 = (1, 2, 3) and tuple2 = (4, 5, 6). Concatenate the two tuples into a new tuple called combined_tuple. Print the result.

Problem 4: List Slicing
Given the list numbers = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9], use slicing to:

Extract the first three elements.

Extract the last four elements.

Extract every second element from the list.

Print the results.

Problem 5: Tuple and List Conversion
Create a tuple my_tuple = (7, 8, 9).

Convert the tuple into a list called my_list.

Add the number 10 to the list.

Convert the list back into a tuple called new_tuple.

Print the final tuple.
