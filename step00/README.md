 # Day 1 - What is Programming and Python?

## What is Programming?

Programming is a way for us to tell computers what to do. Computers are very basic machines, and they only do what we tell them to do. In other words, they don’t have the intelligence to think like humans. Hence, we learn programming to instruct computers to perform tasks that would take us too long to do, like complex calculations.

For example, if I ask you to calculate 5 + 6, you would immediately say 11. But if I asked you to calculate 23,453,453 * 56,456, you would likely have to search for a calculator or open a new tab to find the answer. This is where programming comes in—allowing us to automate and quickly perform calculations and many other tasks.

This "100 days of code" series will guide you step-by-step through learning Python from scratch. By the end of this series, you will be a job-ready Python developer!

## What is Python?

Python is a dynamically typed, general-purpose programming language that supports both object-oriented programming (OOP) and functional programming paradigms.

- Python is an **interpreted** language, meaning the code is executed line by line.
- It is a **high-level** language, meaning it is designed to be easy for humans to read and write, abstracting the complex machine code away.
- Python was created by **Guido Van Rossum** in **1989**.

## Features of Python

- **Simple and easy to understand**: Python has a clean and easy-to-read syntax that makes it beginner-friendly.
- **Interpreted and platform-independent**: Python code can run on any platform (Windows, macOS, Linux) without modification, and its interpreted nature makes debugging simpler.
- **Open-source**: Python is free to use and has a large and active community.
- **Large library support**: Python comes with a massive standard library and has many third-party libraries available for use. Some popular libraries include:
  - **NumPy**: for numerical computing
  - **TensorFlow**: for machine learning
  - **Selenium**: for web automation
  - **OpenCV**: for computer vision
- **Integration**: Python can integrate with other programming languages like C, C++, and Java.

## What is Python used for?

Python is incredibly versatile and used in various fields, such as:

- **Data Visualization**: Python is widely used to create plots and graphical representations of data.
- **Data Analytics**: Python helps analyze raw data and derive insights and trends.
- **AI and Machine Learning**: Python is a leading language for simulating human behavior and learning from data without the need for hard coding.
- **Web Development**: Python can be used to build web applications using frameworks like Django and Flask.
- **Database Management**: Python can interact with databases to store, retrieve, and manipulate data.
- **Business and Accounting**: Python performs complex mathematical operations and supports quantitative and qualitative analysis.
