1)Create a class Person with the following private instance variables:

String name
int age
Write a getter and setter method for each variable (name and age).

2)Create a class BankAccount with a private instance variable:

double balance
Write a getter for the balance and a setter that ensures the balance cannot be set to a negative value. If a negative value is passed, the setter should print "Invalid amount" and set the balance to 0 instead.

3)Private Setter
Create a class Book with the following private instance variables:

String title
String author
Write a getter for both variables and a setter for the title variable. The setter for author should be private. Answer the following:

How can you modify the author of a Book instance directly from outside the class? Will the setter for author be accessible from other classes?

4)Create a class Rectangle with the following private instance variables:

double length
double width
The class should have a constructor to initialize both variables. Add getter methods for both length and width, and a setter for length. However, do not provide a setter for width


5)Create a class Employee with the following private instance variables:

String name
int employeeID
double salary
Make the employeeID read-only, meaning there is no setter for it. Provide getters for all variables, but allow the salary to be modified via a setter that ensures it can't be set to a value lower than the current salary.
